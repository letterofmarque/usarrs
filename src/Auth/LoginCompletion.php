/**
 * The one place an interactive login is finished (Spec #142).
 *
 * Every way in — password, magic link, OAuth, straight after registering —
 * proves who the user is in its own way and then hands the user here. This
 * decides whether a two-factor challenge is due and either starts it or signs
 * the user in.
 *
 * It exists because that decision used to be made by each path separately, and
 * the magic-link and OAuth paths never made it: a user with 2FA confirmed was
 * signed straight in by clicking an emailed link. A new login path cannot
 * forget the challenge if it cannot sign anyone in without coming through here
 * — which is why this is the only interactive Auth::login() in usarrs, and a
 * test holds it to that.
 *
 * Passkey sign-in is outside it: laravel/passkeys signs in through its own
 * endpoint, with no TOTP afterwards (a passkey is already phishing-resistant).
 * The README says so rather than claiming every login comes through here.
